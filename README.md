This PowerShell script automates the deployment of Azure infrastructure for a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN lab environment. It is designed to create the foundational components required for a P2S VPN setup, including a resource group, virtual network (VNet), subnets, a public IP address for the VPN gateway, and the VPN gateway itself. However, the configuration of the P2S VPN settings and the creation of a test virtual machine (VM) are left as manual steps.

### Key Features and Steps:

1. **Resource Group Creation**: The script begins by creating a resource group (`P2S-Lab-RG`) in the specified Azure region (`eastus`). This serves as a container for all the resources deployed in the lab.

2. **Virtual Network and Subnets**: A VNet (`P2S-Lab-VNet`) is created with a main address space (`10.55.0.0/16`). Two subnets are defined:
   - **WorkloadSubnet**: This is where the user can manually deploy a test VM. It uses the address prefix `10.55.1.0/24`.
   - **GatewaySubnet**: This is a required subnet for the VPN gateway, with a prefix of `10.55.255.0/27`. Azure mandates that the gateway subnet must be at least `/27` or larger.

3. **Public IP Address for VPN Gateway**: A static, standard SKU public IP address is created for the VPN gateway. This is essential for enabling external connectivity to the gateway.

4. **VPN Gateway Configuration**: The script prepares the VPN gateway's IP configuration by associating it with the `GatewaySubnet` and the public IP address. It then initiates the creation of a route-based VPN gateway (`VpnGw1` SKU) as a background job. This process typically takes 30-45 minutes to complete.

5. **Manual Configuration Steps**: The script does not configure the P2S VPN settings, such as the address pool, tunnel types, or authentication methods. Instead, it provides detailed instructions for completing these steps manually in the Azure Portal. This includes:
   - Setting the P2S address pool (e.g., `172.16.55.0/24`).
   - Choosing tunnel types (e.g., IKEv2 and SSTP).
   - Configuring authentication using Azure certificates.
   - Generating and uploading root and client certificates.
   - Downloading the VPN client configuration.

6. **Test VM Deployment**: While the script does not automate the creation of a test VM, it provides guidance for manually deploying one in the `WorkloadSubnet`. The user is advised to ensure that the VM's network security group (NSG) allows necessary traffic, such as RDP for remote access and ICMP for testing connectivity.

7. **Completion and Next Steps**: The script concludes by summarizing the deployed resources and outlining the remaining manual steps to complete the P2S VPN setup. These include configuring the VPN client, connecting to the VPN, and testing connectivity by pinging the private IP address of the test VM.

### Highlights:
- **Automation**: The script automates the creation of core Azure resources, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable variables allow the user to adapt the script to different environments and requirements.
- **Best Practices**: It follows Azure best practices, such as using a standard SKU public IP for the VPN gateway and ensuring the gateway subnet meets Azure's size requirements.
- **Manual Configuration**: By leaving the P2S VPN settings and test VM deployment as manual steps, the script provides flexibility for users to tailor the configuration to their specific needs.

This script is ideal for setting up a lab environment to test P2S VPN connectivity and related Azure networking features. It provides a balance between automation and manual configuration, making it suitable for both learning and experimentation.
